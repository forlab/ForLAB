#ForLAB (multi-method laboratory quantification tool)
ForLab is a standardized, open-source tool developed by CHAI and SCMS with clearly defined requirements, improving programsâ€™ ability to collect and analyze data to accurately forecast commodity needs. ForLAB performs long- and short-term forecasts and guides improvements in diagnostic services.

##Functionality & features
* Able to analyze the following data sets to
generate informed, evidence-based forecasts:
  * Service statistics (test numbers)
